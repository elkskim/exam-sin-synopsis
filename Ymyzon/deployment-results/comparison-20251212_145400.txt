Test Configuration:
- System: Ymyzon Microservices (2 services + RabbitMQ)
- Services: OrderService, InventoryService
- Messaging: RabbitMQ
- Platform: Docker + .NET 9

========================================

MANUAL DEPLOYMENT RESULTS
========================================
Number of runs:     3
Total time:         589s
Average time:       196s (3.27 minutes)
Total errors:       0
Average errors:     0.0 per run
Steps per deploy:   13
Human interaction:  Required for all 13 steps

Individual runs:
  Run 1: 262s, 0 errors
  Run 2: 157s, 0 errors
  Run 3: 170s, 0 errors

AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT RESULTS
========================================
Number of runs:     3
Total time:         162s
Average time:       54s (0.90 minutes)
Total errors:       0
Average errors:     0.0 per run
Steps automated:    100%
Human interaction:  1 command only

Individual runs:
  Run 1: 56s, 0 errors
  Run 2: 53s, 0 errors
  Run 3: 53s, 0 errors

COMPARISON & IMPROVEMENTS
========================================
Time saved:         142s per deployment (2.37 minutes)
Time improvement:   72.45% faster
Error reduction:    0.0 fewer errors per deployment
Consistency:        Automated = reproducible, Manual = variable

Manual deployment variance: 105s (262s max, 157s min) - HIGH VARIABILITY
Automated deployment variance: 3s (56s max, 53s min) - LOW VARIABILITY

Key Findings:
- Automated deployment requires 72.45% less time
- Reduced from 13 manual steps to 1 command (92.3% complexity reduction)
- Automated deployment is 35x more consistent (variance: 3s vs 105s)
- Human error potential eliminated
- Deployment process is reproducible and consistent

ROI Analysis:
- Per deployment: Save 2.37 minutes
- Per week (5 deploys): Save 11.85 minutes
- Per month (20 deploys): Save 47.4 minutes
- Per year (240 deploys): Save 9.48 hours of developer time
